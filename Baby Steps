Chapter One 
 PYTHON BASICS.

I will be doing all this practicing on VSCODE. I have also downloaded the python software so the program can actually run. 
Lets Learn Expressions with Python. 

2+2

** above is called an expression.

More examples of an expression are:
2*4
4/12
2-1
Expressions are the basic kind of programming instruction in the language. It consist of values and operators. A single value with no operators is also considered as an expression, although 
it evaluates only to itself.

There are many operators you can use in python expressions. 
some examples include. 

** <- Operator 
Exponent <- Operation 
2**# <- Example 
8 <- what it is equal too. 

% <- Operator 
Modulus/remainder <- Operation
22 % 8 <- Example 
6 <- what it is equal too.

+ <- Operator 
Addition <- Operation 
2+2 <- Example 
4 <- what it is equal too.
