So the input() function waits for the user to type some text on the keyboard and press ENTER.
myName = input()

So this function call evaluates to a string equal to the users text and the line of code asssigns the myName variable to this string calue. 

You can think of the input() function call as an expression that evaluates to whatever string the user typed in.
