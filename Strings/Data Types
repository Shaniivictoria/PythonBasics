Continuing in Chapter One. 
Now we are on the Data Types and Strings.

A data type is a category for values and every value belongs to exactly one data type.
The most common data types in python are Integers, Floating point numbers and strings. 

Python programs can have text values called strings or strs.
Always surround your string in single quote. Ex ('Hello Stranger') or ('Goodbye cruel world").
This is so that python understand where the string begins and ends. 
You can also have a string with no character in it. As for now. The book states well learn more about it in chapter 4 and we are doing a chapter a day so well get back into it.

 A common error message will show and it probably means you forgot the final single quote charachter at the end of the string. 

error message SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

ex: >>> 'Hello, World!

 SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

Strong Concatentation and Replication:

This is when + is used on two strings values, and it joins the strings as string concatenation operator. 
Ex: 
'Shani' + 'Diaz'
in the shell it will come out as 
'ShaniDiaz'

You will get an error if you try to use + operator on a string and an integer value.
Example: 'Shani' + 45
The error message will be TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str

This error message means that Python thought you were trying to concatenate an interger to the string "Shani'.

The * operator multiples two integers or floating point values. However when the  * operator is used on one string value and one integer value, it becomes the string replication operator. 

Ex: >> 'Shani' *5
'ShaniShaniShaniShaniShani'

A variable is like a boc in the computers memory where you can store a single value. 
You will store values in variables with an assignment statment. 

An Assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal assignment operator (which is the equal sign.) and the value to be stored.
